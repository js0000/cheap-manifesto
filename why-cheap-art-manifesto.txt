the WHY CHEAP ART? manifesto

PEOPLE have been THINKING too long that ART is a PRIVLEDGE of the
MUSEUMS & the RICH. ART IS NOT BUSINESS!

It does not belong to banks & fancy investors ART IS FOOD. You
cant EAT it BUT it FEEDS you. ART has to be CHEAP & available to
EVERYBODY. It needs to be EVERYWHERE because it is the INSIDE of
the WORLD.

ART SOOTHES PAIN!
Art wakes up sleepers!
ART FIGHTS AGAINST WAR & STUPIDITY.
ART SINGS HALLELUJA!
ART IS FOR KITCHENS!
ART IS LIKE GOOD BREAD!
Art is like green trees!
Art is like white clouds in blue sky!
ART IS CHEAP!
HURRAH!
